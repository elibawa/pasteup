Introduction
============

Pasteup is where design meets development. It is where the Guardianâ€™s globally recognised design language is turned into code for the web, and the starting point when styling Guardian branded products for both internal teams and third parties.

**Why Pasteup?** It's a newspaper term for "the assemblage of pages by pasting type onto page mockups, which are then photographed to be made into metal plates for the printing press" (courtesy of John E McIntyre). This is quite a nice metaphor for how client-side development builds the Guardian's pages. Plus it sounds cool.
